# Serenity Discord Wordle Leaderboart Bot with Shuttle

This bot will pick up on when someone posts their wordle score, e.g:

Wordle 1,005 5/6

â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ© <br>
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ© <br>
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ© <br>
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ© <br>

and will save it to the leaderboard.

Someone in the discord server can then type "!wordle" and the bot will post a message with the current wordle leaderboard.

The score is calculated by averaging all of the wordle scores a user has posted. The lower the score, the better.
